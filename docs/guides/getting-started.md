# Getting Started with Engram

Memory infrastructure for AI agents that actually works.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 20
- **pnpm** ≥ 9 (`corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9 --activate`)
- **PostgreSQL** 16 with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension
  - Easiest: use the `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` Docker image

## Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

The fastest way to get running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openengram/engram.git
cd engram
docker compose up
```

This starts PostgreSQL (with pgvector) and the Engram API on `http://localhost:3001`. Embeddings run locally — no API keys needed.

## Manual Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openengram/engram.git
cd engram
pnpm install
```

### Configure Environment

Copy the example config:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set your database URL:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://engram:engram@localhost:5432/engram
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://engram:engram@localhost:5432/engram
```

Optionally set an API key to protect your instance:

```env
AM_API_KEY=your-secret-key-here
```

### Run Database Migrations

```bash
npx prisma generate
pnpm run migrate:deploy
```

### Start the Server

```bash
pnpm start:dev    # Development (hot reload)
pnpm start:prod   # Production (requires pnpm build first)
```

The API is available at `http://localhost:3001`. Interactive docs at `http://localhost:3001/api/docs`.

## Create Your First Agent

Agents are created implicitly when you store a memory with an `agentId`. Let's create one called `my-agent`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/v1/memories \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-AM-API-Key: your-secret-key-here" \
  -H "X-AM-User-ID: user-1" \
  -H "X-AM-Agent-ID: my-agent" \
  -d '{
    "content": "The user prefers dark mode and uses vim keybindings."
  }'
```

Engram automatically:
- Extracts entities, topics, and memory type via LLM
- Generates a vector embedding
- Scores importance
- Stores everything in PostgreSQL

## Store Your First Memory

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/v1/memories \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-AM-API-Key: your-secret-key-here" \
  -H "X-AM-User-ID: user-1" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Project deadline is March 15th. The client wants the dashboard redesigned with a focus on mobile responsiveness.",
    "agentId": "my-agent"
  }'
```

The response includes the extracted metadata:

```json
{
  "id": "clx...",
  "content": "Project deadline is March 15th...",
  "extraction": {
    "entities": ["March 15th", "dashboard"],
    "topics": ["project management", "design"],
    "memoryType": "FACT"
  },
  "importance": 0.7
}
```

## Your First Recall

Retrieve relevant memories using semantic search:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/v1/recall \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-AM-API-Key: your-secret-key-here" \
  -H "X-AM-User-ID: user-1" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What are the project deadlines?",
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

For richer context-aware recall:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/v1/recall/contextual \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-AM-API-Key: your-secret-key-here" \
  -H "X-AM-User-ID: user-1" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What do I need to know about the project?",
    "agentId": "my-agent",
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

## Generate Context for Prompts

Get a formatted context block ready to inject into your LLM system prompt:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/v1/context \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-AM-API-Key: your-secret-key-here" \
  -H "X-AM-User-ID: user-1" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Help with the dashboard project",
    "maxTokens": 2000
  }'
```

## Agent Self-Reflection

After a conversation session, trigger agent self-reflection to build self-awareness:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/v1/agents/my-agent/reflect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-AM-API-Key: your-secret-key-here" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "user-1",
    "conversationTurns": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Can you help me debug this?" },
      { "role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, let me look at the error..." }
    ]
  }'
```

## Check Health

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/v1/health
```

Returns database status, embedding service health, memory counts, and uptime.
